# AUTO1 live coding challange

------------------
There are 3 numbers from 1-3 you need to implement them one after another

```
1 Let's keep it simple

Storage

Write a method that takes two parameters: a key and a secret. Store them and return the given key. 

Constraints:
1. key (not longer than 20): f.e. mY-cUsTom-kEy 
2. secret: f.e. My secret no one should know!
3. key (case-insensitive): f.e. "mY-cUsTom-kEy" or "my-custom-key"

Retrieval:
Write a method that takes one parameter, the key, and returns the stored secret. 


-------------------------------

2 Allow the key to be a number
  key: f.e. 255

-------------------------------

3 Generate the key
  Add functionality to generate a random key.
  f.e. "T4iz2Q"
```
